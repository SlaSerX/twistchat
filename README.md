Chatroom
=========

Miniature IRC-style chatroom written in about 200 lines of Python. Only stores state in RAM, so if the server dies, the accounts are gone too. 

Todo:

* Store accounts more permanently
* Improve username formatting
* Change telnet prompts (probably can't do this)
* Broadcast messages when users join and leave
* Take another look at the `users` and `connections` dicts - probably some redundancy there
*
